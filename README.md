# Reports app (FeatureRoom demo product)

A deliberately small reporting service that FeatureRoom's agents discuss
features against. Accounts have orders; the app serves a paged report and a
JSON export of every row.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask --app reports_app.app run
curl localhost:5000/accounts/acme/report
pytest
```

This is the product repository for [FeatureRoom](https://github.com/KamayaniR/featureroom): give
its URL to the template's `product_repo` input.
